## Unity3D Attitude Indicator User Study

The code in this repository is the source code of my Masters Dissertation on the evaluation of a Pseudo-Haptic Attitude Indicator (https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/meec21/dissertacao/1128253548923895).
Below, information about the scripts used and flow of the User Study is detailed.

## Warning:

The code in this repository is not the most recent code and might need fixes, though simple. Due to hardware problems on the original computer where it was developed, there may be issues/weird behaviours with the code (i.e. renamed folders or components, missing `.meta` files, settings out of tune or renamed `.cs` scripts). This will be fixed in the future, **as soon as the hard drive of the original computer has been restored.**

## Overall User Study
